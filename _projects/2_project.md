 The [IML4E project](https://iml4e.org/) directly addresses the specifics of AI and ML by providing interoperability, automation and reusability in the data and the training pipeline. Moreover, IML4E enables continuous quality assurance and supervision for different types of machine learning (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, etc.) throughout the whole life cycle of a smart software solution. To fully achieve the technical and business goals of the project, we have integrated research and industry partners, that operate along the value chain from data processing, over the training of ML models, to the provision and operation of smart software and services.
