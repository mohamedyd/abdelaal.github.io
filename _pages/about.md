I serve as a Senior Research Scientist and Project Leader at <a href='https://www.softwareag.com/'> Software AG</a> located in Darmstadt, Germany. I am responsible for the publicly-funded collaborative research projects. We cooperate with many companies and research institutions, primarily in Germany and Europe. In this role, I manage and work on several research projects related to machine learning, data quality, and MLOps. In 2023, I received the Elevating Excellence Award in innovation for my work at Software AG.

My academic and professional journey is a testament to my passion for research and innovation. I pursued my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Oldenburg, Germany, where my thesis focused on the intersection of energy efficiency and service quality in wireless sensing. Following my doctorate, I continued to explore the realms of AI and IoT through postdoctoral research and as a lecturer at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
